### WSL2 Notes
- Starting docker daemon in WSL2 cannot be done inside VSCode Terminal. Open a different terminal and enter `sudo service docker start`.
- Using development container expects Docker to be installed on Windows. To use the docker installed in WSL2, set `Dev â€º Containers: Execute In WSL` to `true` in `Settings`.
